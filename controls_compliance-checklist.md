# Recommendations: 

Botium Toy’s security posture needs a lot of improvement. Multiple controls have failed to be implemented which leaves the company vulnerable to data breaches and cyber attacks which would cost the company a lot of money, their reputation, and hinder business continuity following attacks. These controls need to be implemented to improve Botium Toys’ security posture and better ensure the confidentiality of sensitive information, including: Least Privilege, separation of duties, disaster recovery plans, password policies, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), ongoing legacy system management, encryption, and a password management system.

To better meet compliance standards, Botium Toys needs to implement controls such as Least Privilege, separation of duties, and encryption. The company also needs to properly classify assets, to identify additional controls that may need to be implemented to improve their security posture and better protect sensitive information.
